Inorder, to classify the images and identity decision boundaries it is very important to also indentify more complex non-linear patterns of input image.So, an non-linear activation is preferred to classify the image. As per the universal approximation theorem its only possible to approximate a continuous function f(x) defined on a compact subset of a real-valued space, with non-linear activation functions to achieve good level of accuracy. This allows the neural network with at atleast single hidden layer and non-activation functions to act as universal approximators.\n",

    " In max-pooling,a window(usually of shape 2x2 and 3x3) slides over the feature map of previous convolutional layer.At each position of the sliding window, the maximum value that window is selected and passed as the output in the new feature map.Later,kernel shifts over the feature map with strides.\n",
    " As a result, the output feature map has reduced dimensions, but retains the important features from the original feature map This helps in maintaining the most prominent patterns from the image while reducing spatial resolution.Also, by selecting the maximum value makes the neural network more invariant to small transitions or shifts in the image.\n",
